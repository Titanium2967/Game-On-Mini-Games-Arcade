Scores are awarded for each win, and remain exclusive for a user throughout their game history. 
Game On! - Mini Games Arcade can be briefly divided into the following components:
I.	Tic-Tac-Toe! is played on a 3x3 grid in Single Player Mode where the Player competes against the computer. 
The first player marks their moves with a cross and the computer does so with a circle. Whomever first forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal sequence of three marks, is declared the winner.
This program draws the game board, asks the user for the coordinates of the next mark, swaps between the players after every successive move, and displays the winner.

II.	Rock-Paper-Scissors! is played in Single Player Mode with an interactive interface that provides the user access to command controls to select the input option of their choice from ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’, and ‘Scissors’. 
It is played between a user and the computer, and the first player to win three rounds wins. Its interactive animations and score board make its features unique and user friendly. 
III. Hangman (Countries Edition!):
Hangman is a popular word puzzle game that challenges players’ word-guessing skills and deductive reasoning. The game involves a secret country, which is selected and its number of characters is displayed to the user. The player then has to guess each letter of the word and should manage to identify the word within 9 tries.
 The game displays the partially guessed word with blanks for unguessed letters. The guessing player wins if they think is the word within the allowed attempts; otherwise, they lose.
The game uses tkinter for building its GUI application and utilizes modules such as random and country_list to make it more efficient and interactive. 
Images have been used to provide a narrative and thereby enhance user experience.
